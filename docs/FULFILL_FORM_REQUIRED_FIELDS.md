## Validation Implementation

### HTML5 Validation

- Email field uses `type="email"` for format validation

### JavaScript Validation
- Custom validation for checkbox group (wishes to fulfill)
- Validates at least one checkbox is checked before form submission
- Prevents form submission and shows alert if validation fails

### Conditional Required Fields
- Practitioner dropdown: Required only when "Select from recommended" is chosen
- Custom practitioner name: Required only when "Provide your own" is chosen
- Process agreement checkbox: Required only when "Provide your own" is chosen
- JavaScript toggles the `required` attribute based on radio button selection

## Visual Indicators

- Required fields show red asterisk (`<span class="text-red-600">*</span>`) in label
- Optional field (Timeline) has "(optional)" text in label
- Optional field uses lighter gray color (`text-gray-600`) for label

## User Experience

### Before Submission
