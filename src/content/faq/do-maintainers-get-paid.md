question: "Don't the maintainers also get paid?"

Yes, and they absolutely should be! This platform is designed to help provide critical human support that many maintainers need - such as governance advice, security audits, funding strategy, and community moderation - **not to replace the need to pay maintainers for their work**.

Open source maintainers deserve fair compensation for the incredible value they create. The services offered through OSS Wishlist are complementary needs that help make projects more sustainable, secure, and professionally managed.

## One-Time Sponsorship (Honorarium)

To further support maintainers, wish sponsors (companies or organizations fulfilling wishes) are offered the option to provide a one-time honorarium to the maintainer as part of wish fulfillment. This is entirely optional but encouraged as a way to:

- Show appreciation for the maintainer's work and time
- Recognize the effort maintainers put into collaborating with practitioners
- Provide a token of gratitude for their contributions to open source
- Strengthen the relationship between sponsors and maintainers

**Important**: This honorarium is **not** payment for the maintainer's services, nor does it create any obligation beyond working with the practitioner. It's simply a gesture of appreciation for the maintainer's time and collaboration during the wish fulfillment process.

Maintainers can opt-in to receive these honorariums when creating their wishlist. If they do, sponsors will be asked during the fulfillment process if they'd like to include a one-time honorarium alongside the professional service they're providing.

This approach recognizes that sustainable open source requires both professional services **and** direct maintainer compensation.
