Practitioners are compensated directly by the Ecosystem Sponsors who sponsor the work:

- **Direct Payment**: Sponsors pay practitioners directly, not through the platform
- **Fair Rates**: We provide guidance on market rates to ensure fair compensation
- **Flexible Terms**: Payment schedules and methods are negotiated between sponsors and practitioners
- **Milestone-Based**: Most projects use milestone-based payments to ensure progress and accountability
- **Documentation**: All payment agreements are documented for transparency and dispute resolution

The platform facilitates the connection and provides frameworks for agreements, but does not handle payment processing directly.
