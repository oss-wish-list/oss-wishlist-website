Our practitioner selection process ensures quality and reliability:

2. **Background Verification**: We verify credentials, references, and previous project outcomes
3. **Skills Assessment**: Practitioners demonstrate knowledge in their claimed specialty areas
4. **Community Standing**: We check reputation within open source communities and professional networks
5. **Ongoing Evaluation**: Performance is monitored through project outcomes and client feedback

We prioritize practitioners who understand the unique challenges of open source projects and demonstrate commitment to the ecosystem's long-term health.
