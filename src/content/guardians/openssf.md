## About OpenSSF

The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) is a cross-industry collaboration that brings together the industry's most important open source security initiatives and the individuals and companies that support them. 

OpenSSF brings together open source security initiatives under one foundation to accelerate work through cross-industry collaboration, and provide a single focal point for the open source security community to come together and identify new initiatives and best practices.

## Key Programs

### Alpha-Omega Project
The Alpha-Omega Project is an initiative to improve the security of open source software by supporting security audits and remediation of the most critical open source projects.

- **Alpha**: Direct security work on the most critical OSS projects
- **Omega**: Build comprehensive security assessment tools for all OSS

### Scorecard
An automated security assessment tool that evaluates open source projects for security best practices and generates security scorecards.

### Supply Chain Security
Working groups focused on securing the open source software supply chain through standards, tools, and education.
