# Developer Relations Strategy Playbook

A practical playbook for maintainers and practitioners to grow healthy developer communities around open source projects. Use this as a guide alongside your project’s goals and constraints.

## Outcomes we aim for

- Clear audience segmentation and value propositions
- Consistent content and engagement plan that compounds over time
- Measurable contributor onboarding and retention improvements
- Sustainable maintainer workload (no heroics required)

## Core components

### 1) Audience and messaging
- Define primary developer audiences (users, contributors, integrators, partners)
- Map top problems each audience has and how the project helps
- Write 2–3 messaging pillars and proof points per audience

### 2) Channels and cadence
- Choose 2–3 primary channels to start (docs, blog, GitHub Discussions, one social)
- Establish realistic cadence (e.g., 2 posts/month, monthly office hours)
- Reuse content across channels with lightweight adaptation

### 3) Contributor path
- Create a simple “First contribution” path: labels, templates, guardrails
- Document roles and expectations (triager, reviewer, maintainer)
- Publish a weekly/biweekly “good first tasks” digest

### 4) Events and outreach
- Maintain a talk/topic backlog; align with release roadmap
- Prefer lightweight, repeatable formats (community calls, show & tell)
- Track CFPs relevant to your ecosystem; prepare abstract templates

### 5) Measurement
- Define a small KPI set: newcomers per month, first-PR conversion rate, repeat contributors, content reach
- Review monthly; adjust tactics based on signal, not vanity metrics

## DevRel Strategy – Peer Review Rubric

Score each criterion from 0–4
(0 = missing, 1 = weak, 2 = adequate, 3 = strong, 4 = excellent)

| Area | What good looks like | Score |
|------|-----------------------|-------|
| Audience & Messaging | Clear audience segments with value propositions and examples | 0–4 |
| Channels & Cadence | 2–3 primary channels with realistic cadence and ownership | 0–4 |
| Contributor Path | Documented first-contribution path and role expectations | 0–4 |
| Events & Outreach | Lightweight, repeatable formats; topic backlog maintained | 0–4 |
| Measurement | Few meaningful KPIs tracked monthly; actions taken | 0–4 |
