# Example Web Framework Utilities Wishlist

## Project Overview

Example Web Framework Utilities is a comprehensive testing library that provides modern utilities for web application testing. We've built this library to help developers write better tests with less boilerplate code.

## What We're Looking For

We're seeking practitioner help to take our project to the next level. Our main focus areas are:

### Security Audit
We're preparing for a major v2.0 release and want to ensure our security practices are rock-solid. We need a comprehensive security review covering:
- Dependency analysis
- Code security patterns
- Supply chain security
- Best practices recommendations
