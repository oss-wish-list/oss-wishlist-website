# Example Web Framework Utilities Wishlist

## Project Overview

Example Web Framework Utilities is a comprehensive testing library that provides modern utilities for web application testing. We've built this library to help developers write better tests with less boilerplate code.

## What We're Looking For

We're seeking practitioner help to take our project to the next level. Our main focus areas are:

### Security Audit
We're preparing for a major v2.0 release and want to ensure our security practices are rock-solid. We need a comprehensive security review covering:
- Dependency analysis
- Code security patterns
- Supply chain security
- Best practices recommendations

### Documentation Overhaul
Our documentation has grown organically and needs professional restructuring:
- API documentation improvement
- Tutorial creation for beginners
- Migration guides
- Interactive examples

### Community Growth
We want to build a thriving contributor community:
- Onboarding process design
- Contributor guidelines
- Mentorship program setup
- Community event planning

### Performance Optimization
As our user base grows, we need practitioner guidance on:
- Bundle size optimization
- Runtime performance improvements
- Benchmarking setup
- Performance monitoring

## Our Team

We're a small but dedicated team of developers who are passionate about developer experience. We've been maintaining this project for 3 years and have seen steady growth in adoption.

## Timeline & Budget

We're looking to complete these initiatives by Q1 2025. We have allocated a budget of $5k-20k for practitioner consulting services, depending on the scope of work.

## Get In Touch

If you're an practitioner in any of these areas and would like to help us grow, please reach out! We're particularly interested in working with consultants who have experience with open source projects and understand the unique challenges we face.
