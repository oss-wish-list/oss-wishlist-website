Open Source Wishlist bridges the gap between open source projects that need support and the ecosystem that depends on them. We provide a structured pathway for maintainers to get expert help in critical areas like security, governance, funding strategy, and community building.

## The Process

A simple three-step process that connects needs with resources

### 1. Maintainers Create Wishlists

Open source maintainers browse our catalog of services and resources, then create a wishlist identifying critical needs for their project's sustainability.

- Choose from curated services and resources
- Services include security audits, governance setup, funding strategy, and more
- Resources include infrastructure hosting, moderation tools, etc.
- Wishlists are currently public (transitioning to private for security)

### 2. Wishlist Sponsors Fund Wishes

Companies, foundations, and individuals who depend on open source step in to fund one or more wishes from a project's wishlist.

- Browse active wishlists from projects you depend on
- Fund specific services or resources
- Funds managed through GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective
- Direct, measurable impact on project sustainability

### 3. Practitioners Deliver Services

Vetted open source practitioners with validated expertise are matched with funded wishes to deliver professional services.

- Practitioners meet quality standards set by OSS Wishlist
- Hired through our platform or provided by Wishlist Sponsors
- Work directly with maintainers on critical needs
- Fair compensation for expertise and labor

Funds flow through established platforms like GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective. Work is documented and verifiable. Impact is measurable.
