# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025

## Our Commitment to Privacy

OSS Wishlist ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. We have designed our platform to minimize data collection and maintain transparency about how we handle your information.

## Information We Collect

### 1. GitHub Authentication Data

When you sign in with GitHub OAuth, we receive and temporarily store:
- GitHub username
- Public email address  
- GitHub profile information (name, avatar, user ID)
- GitHub OAuth access token

**Purpose:** To authenticate your identity and access your public GitHub information on your behalf (such as repositories you own).

**Storage:** Your OAuth access token is stored temporarily in an encrypted, httpOnly session cookie. We use this token to make API calls to GitHub on your behalf.

**Retention:** Session data (including the access token) is automatically deleted when you log out or after 24 hours of inactivity. We do not store access tokens in any database.

### 2. Wishlist Data

When you create a wishlist, we collect:
- Project repository information
- Service needs and descriptions
- Technologies used
- Preferred fulfillment methods

**Purpose:** To publicly display open source maintainer project's needs and connect maintainers with sponsors and practitioners.

**Storage:** All wishlists are stored as **public issues** in our GitHub repository ([oss-wishlist/wishlists](https://github.com/oss-wishlist/wishlists)). This data is publicly accessible by design.

**Retention:** Wishlists remain public until you close them or request deletion.

### 3. Practitioner Application Data

When you apply to become a practitioner, we collect:
- Full name
- Contact email
- Service expertise
- Professional background
- LinkedIn/website (optional)

**Purpose:** To review and verify your qualifications.

**Storage:** Application data is **sent directly to our administrators via email** and is **not stored in any database**. If approved, we create a public profile page (markdown file) in our repository with the information you provided.

**Retention:** Email applications are retained according to our email provider's policies. Public profiles remain until you request deletion.

### 4. Sponsor Request Data

When you submit a fulfillment request, we collect:
- Your contact information
- Organization details (if applicable)
- Service offering details

**Purpose:** To facilitate connections between sponsors/practitioners and maintainers.

**Storage:** Request data is **sent directly to the wishlist creator via email** and is **not stored in any database**. Our administrative email address (info@oss-wishlist.com) is hosted by PrivateEmail.com.

**Retention:** Email requests are retained according to our email hosting provider's policies. We do not maintain a separate copy.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We explicitly do not collect:
- Financial or payment information
- Detailed analytics or tracking data
- Personal information beyond what is necessary for the services above
