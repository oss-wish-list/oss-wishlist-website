<!-- 
  NOTE: Pricing values shown below are for display purposes.
  The source of truth for pricing data is in each service's frontmatter (src/content/services/*.md).
  When updating prices:
  1. Update the individual service file frontmatter (e.g., governance-setup.md)
  2. Update the corresponding table below to match
  This ensures pricing is consistent across the platform (catalog, wishlist form, fulfill page).

## Focus on Community

This is not a company. It's a collaborative space where maintainers, practitioners, and sponsors come together to strengthen open source sustainability. Our pricing tiers are a baseline proposal, and open to evolve with community input.  


### Understanding Our Pricing Tiers

Each pricing tier represents a **complete, quality engagement**. The differences in pricing reflect the **human time investment, project and service complexity**. 

**All services are guided by detailed rubrics and quality standards documented in our [Practitioner Playbooks](/oss-wishlist-website/playbooks)**. These playbooks outline deliverables, success criteria, and assessment frameworks for each service.  

### Pro Bono & Community Support

Practitioners generously offer **pro bono services** for projects that align with their values, particularly those from underrepresented communities, critical infrastructure projects, or work with significant public benefit. Pro bono availability varies by practitioner and is offered at their discretion.

### Payment process

Payment will be made directly to practitioners via GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective in advance, once a wishlist fulfillment has been finalized and scheduled. Payment covers a one-time, single-service engagement. Any requests beyond the initial scope are out of scope for this initiative.
