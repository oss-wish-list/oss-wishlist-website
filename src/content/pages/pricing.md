---

Transparent, human-centered pricing that honors the expertise of practitioners and the sustainability needs of open source projects.

## Our Community Values

This is not a company. It's a collaborative space where maintainers, practitioners, and sponsors come together to strengthen open source sustainability. Our pricing tiers are community-established guidelines that ensure:

- **Fair compensation** that honors practitioners' time and expertise
- **Realistic budgets** that help maintainers and sponsors plan effectively
- **Quality outcomes** through properly scoped, human-centered engagements
- **Sustainable relationships** built on trust and mutual benefit

### Understanding Our Pricing Tiers

Each pricing tier represents a **complete, quality engagement** guided by community-established standards. The differences in pricing reflect the **human time investment and project complexity**. Larger projects naturally involve more people, more intricate relationships, and more nuanced challenges. A small project governance setup might take 20-30 hours working with 1-2 maintainers, while a medium project involves 40-60 hours with 3-10 maintainers, and a large project could require 80-120 hours coordinating across 20+ people with complex decision-making needs. Each tier delivers thorough, collaborative work appropriate to the community's scale.

### Pro Bono & Community Support

Many practitioners generously offer **pro bono services** for projects that align with their values, particularly those from underrepresented communities, critical infrastructure projects, or work with significant public benefit. Pro bono availability varies by practitioner and is offered at their discretion.

## Community Questions

### How are project sizes determined?

Project size reflects the number of people involved, community activity, and complexity of needs. During your initial conversation, practitioners work collaboratively with you to determine the most appropriate tier for your community's situation.

### Are these prices flexible?

Our pricing tiers are community-established guidelines designed to honor fair compensation. Every project is unique, and practitioners may adjust pricing based on specific circumstances, scope changes, or long-term partnerships. However, our community values prevent significant underbidding that devalues people's expertise and time.

### How does pro bono work happen?

Practitioners offering pro bono services typically prioritize projects with significant public benefit, those serving underrepresented communities, critical infrastructure, or projects without alternative funding sources. Each practitioner makes their own decisions about pro bono work based on their values and capacity.

### What's included in the pricing?

All pricing includes the practitioner's time, expertise, and the deliverables outlined in the service description. Any additional tools, travel, or specialized resources are discussed openly and agreed upon together before work begins.

### How are practitioners compensated?

Practitioners receive payment directly through their Open Collective or GitHub Sponsors accounts. Sometimes matches are made with people who work at ecosystem sponsor organizations. In these cases, we trust those organizations to recognize and reward their team members' contributions in ways that work for everyone.
