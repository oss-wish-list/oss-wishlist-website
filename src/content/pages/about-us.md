# About Us

`Open Source Wishlist`  *is* an open source, open content, community project created by Emma Irwin, in partnership open source collaborator Christos Bacharakis and with feedback from many of our peers, maintainers and potential funders . 

# About Open Source Wishlist

Open source projects cannot be sustainabile without help. Direct funding helps in some ways (and we should keep doing that!), but it also leaves addition work with the maintainers to use that money in ways that make their project actually sustainable.

Sponsors often fund projects, but have a hard time describing how those funds had impact on sustainablity.

# Pracitioners

**Practitioners** We are open source pracitioners, but one of MANY open source pracitioners with availability, skill and empathy who can easily step into help open source projects repair, uplevel and build a more sustainable future.  Guided by industry standards, we've all helped write, build and improve - our time can really make a difference - and yet that connection is missing. 

We believe that by creating this connection, we can really make a huge difference for open source sustainability. 

**We expect a to learn along the way, and appreciate all report-backs**.
