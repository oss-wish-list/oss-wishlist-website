# About Us

OSS Wishlist is a community-led project created by open source people, on volunteer time, to try something new for sustainability.

> **Community first:** We're practitioners and community folks with deep open source experience, working on this in our own time because we believe it can help.

## Who

A small community of open source contributors, maintainers, and program leaders. We're not a vendor. We organize connections between projects that need help and professionals who can provide it.

**Practitioners** are experts with meaningful open source experience. They might be independent, part-time, or full-time employees of sponsors. What matters is proven capability and transparent delivery.

## Why

Sustainability often asks maintainers to do everything. We're trying a complementary approach: bring the right talent and expertise into projects so maintainers don't have to carry every responsibility alone.

- Turn "we should" into scoped, fundable work
- Lower activation energy for sponsors to help responsibly
- Create measurable outcomes projects can point to

## When

Now. This is an evolving community project. We're iterating openly and improving based on feedback from maintainers, sponsors, and practitioners.

## Where

Anywhere your projects live. We use GitHub Issues as the public, auditable record for "wishlists" and work delivery, and we surface approved wishes on this site to make them discoverable.

## How

Maintainers describe needs. Sponsors pick work to fund. Practitioners deliver. We focus on non-code and cross-cutting work where dedicated expertise unlocks outsized impact.

- Governance, security, documentation, community, funding, metrics
- Clear scopes of work, transparent milestones, and public tracking
- Approval signals and moderation for quality and safety

## Accountability

We align outcomes with established community standards:

- Community health and social impact guided by [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/)
- Security posture and best practices informed by [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/)

Practitioners commit to delivering against agreed scope, publicly traceable. Sponsors see what was delivered. Maintainers keep control.
