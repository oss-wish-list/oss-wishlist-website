**Solution:** Establish technical steering committee and distribute decision-making authority.

### Quality Control
*"We want more contributors but maintain code quality and project vision."*

**Solution:** Create comprehensive contributor guidelines with automated and human review processes.

### Succession Planning
*"What happens to the project if I can't continue maintaining it?"*

**Solution:** Develop maintainer onboarding and knowledge transfer procedures.
