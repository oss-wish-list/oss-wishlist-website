## Credit Allocation

- **Small Projects**: $100-300/month for basic hosting and development
- **Growing Projects**: $300-600/month for scaling infrastructure
- **Large Projects**: $600-1000/month for enterprise-level needs

## Ideal For

- Projects needing reliable, scalable cloud infrastructure
- Teams requiring robust CI/CD and deployment pipelines
- Applications with global user bases needing CDN services
- Projects with varying compute demands (auto-scaling)
- Teams wanting to leverage AWS's extensive service ecosystem

## Getting Started

1. **Project Assessment**: Evaluate current and projected infrastructure needs
2. **Credit Application**: Apply with project details and usage estimates
3. **Account Setup**: Configure AWS account with appropriate permissions
4. **Resource Planning**: Design architecture and estimate monthly usage
5. **Implementation**: Deploy infrastructure with cost monitoring enabled

## Best Practices

- Set up billing alerts and cost monitoring from day one
- Use AWS Free Tier services where applicable to extend credit value
- Implement auto-scaling to optimize costs during low-usage periods
- Regular cost reviews and optimization recommendations
- Leverage AWS Well-Architected Framework for efficient resource usage
