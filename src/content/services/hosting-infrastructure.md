## Resource Overview

Ensure your open source project has reliable, scalable infrastructure with hosting credits, CI/CD pipelines, and essential deployment resources.

## What's Included

### Cloud Hosting
- Credits for major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean)
- Managed hosting for websites, documentation, and applications
- Database hosting and storage solutions
- CDN and edge computing resources

### CI/CD Infrastructure
- Automated build and deployment pipelines
- Testing infrastructure and automation
- Container registries and orchestration
- Version control and artifact management

### Domain & Security

- SSL/TLS certificates and management
- DNS hosting and configuration
- Security scanning and monitoring tools

### Operations Support
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and logging
- Uptime monitoring and alerts
- Backup and disaster recovery setup

## Ideal For

- Projects requiring scalable web hosting
- Applications needing automated deployment
- Documentation sites and project websites
- Projects transitioning from self-hosted to cloud infrastructure
- Teams requiring professional DevOps setup

## Allocation Tiers

- **Small Projects**: $50-100/month - Basic hosting and CI/CD
- **Medium Projects**: $100-250/month - Multi-environment setup with monitoring
- **Large Projects**: $250-500/month - Enterprise-grade infrastructure with full DevOps support

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: Professional-grade uptime and performance
- **Scalability**: Grow infrastructure as project needs increase
- **Security**: Industry-standard security practices and monitoring
- **Focus**: Maintainers can focus on code, not infrastructure management

## Common Use Cases

- Hosting project documentation and websites
- Running demo applications and showcases
- Automated testing and continuous deployment
- Package and artifact hosting
- API and service hosting

## Requirements

To receive infrastructure resources, projects should demonstrate:
- Active development and maintenance
- Clear infrastructure needs and usage plans
- Commitment to project sustainability
- Willingness to share infrastructure learnings with community
- **Medium Projects**: 5-15 licenses for regular contributors
- **Large Projects**: 15+ licenses based on activity and need

## Getting Started

1. **Team Assessment**: Identify key contributors who would benefit
2. **License Request**: Apply for appropriate number of licenses
3. **Account Setup**: Configure Copilot for team members
4. **Integration**: Set up with existing development environments
